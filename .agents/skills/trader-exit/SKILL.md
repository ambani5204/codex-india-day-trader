# trader-exit: Indian markets (Codex)

Work from the root of the `codex-india-day-trader` project. This is an Indian-market adaptation of the [upstream 11-skill pack](https://github.com/Jakeschincariol/day-trader-skill). It can be invoked as `$trader-exit` in Codex.

## Run

```bash
python tools/india.py exit --signal trader/signal.json --stop mid --rr 1.5
```

Set a stop at the opening-range midpoint or opposite end, and a risk-multiple target. Stop losses are theoretical until separately placed; never imply a broker stop has been submitted.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ with `zoneinfo` (3.9 or later); no third-party dependencies for core/offline tools.
- For live **read-only** market data, create `trader/config.json` by copying `trader/config.example.json`, then set `KITE_API_KEY` and `KITE_ACCESS_TOKEN` in your local environment; never paste secrets into chat.
- For offline analysis supply `--csv` where supported. Confirm date, source, candle interval, correct Asia/Kolkata timezone, and whether bars are fully closed.
- Price data and indices are not executable contracts. Check actual current market structure, expiries, lot sizes and market holidays before any trading decision.

## Hard safety rules

1. Never place live orders. This package has no live-order transport, even if `allow_live_orders` is set.
2. Keep paper trading default, no margin or derivatives by default; require explicit human review.
3. Do not fabricate quotes, historical bars, earnings, disclosures, fill confirmations, or availability.
4. NIFTY 50 and SENSEX are index signals, NOT exchange-tradable instruments. Any proposed index-linked order must use an explicitly chosen tradable contract.
5. Cite market data source and timestamp in analysis; outputs are educational, not guarantees.
